This is just an implementation of the Pencil Durability Kata to get my head around some python concepts

To use this properly, you're gonna need to install all the things found `here <https://github.com/PillarTechnology/apprenticeship-2019Q1/wiki/Creating-a-Safe-Python-Dev-Environment>`_

Upon cloning or downloading, run from the root of the folder::

    poetry install

to ensure all the dependencies are present. Then, you can either enter command::

    poetry run python PencilProgram.py

to run the terminal app or::

    poetry run pytest

to run the tests.
